127888,Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started taking Phentermine just a little over a month ago weighing in at 307. My doctor started me out with half a 37.5 mg pill 2x a day. I immediately felt the medicine start working, the jittery jumping out of your skin feeling and I had a lot of energy the first few days. I sweated profusely and had to have water by my side at all times.  I felt the meds even out and by the 5th day I was asking my doctor to let me take a whole pill once a day. I make sure I take my dose early when I first wake up. So in about 5 weeks I have dropped down to 293. This drug is life changing for me.

Usually within 3 days I would take myself off them because of gaining weight within that period of 3 to 5 pounds, also feeling awful to the point of despair.  I had neck surgery that left me with pain everyday to the point of not wanting to live.  My pain management Doctor prescribed Pristiq along with epidural procedures for pain. Within the first day of taking Pristiq I felt a great difference in my mood.  Within 3 days I knew this medicine was totally different.

Other than that, it improved my mood. I don&#039;t get irritated that quick like I usually do. It cleared up my breakout that I was having on my chin too. I did not experience weight gain.

Zantac and other meds will change your body&#039;s PH and make you likely to get yeast &amp; fungal infections   (2) there is no way to reverse the effects of Pradaxa which is a big issue if you are bleeding in a hospital&#039;s ER.  (3) Pradaxa is great when it comes to diet.  You can eat all the broccoli &amp; vitamin K you want.  (4) Pradaxa does not require biweekly blood tests.

Have not had any periods in 5 years, (spotted a bit the first month only) and plan to continue to use the Implanon until I&#039;m completely menopausal (still perimenopausal).  The only reason I can&#039;t give it a 10 is whenever my blood pressure is taken in the left arm, the implant site &quot;pinches&quot;, solved by having BP taken on the other arm, but I was told I shouldn&#039;t be able to notice it.

It took a good two weeks to get into my system, and I remember thinking it wasn&#039;t working at first.  It&#039;s no Xanax, but it has helped me much more then Paxil and Lexapro did.  This works well for me, and I have no issues taking it for the rest of my life.  I do get some increased hunger and minor dizziness after each dose for about 15 minutes, but that beats being anxious and worrying all the time.  It is also pretty cheap.""",9,24-Apr-13,197

It&#039;s hard for me to imagine all those years of struggling I went through before I was properly diagnosed. I tried Vyvanse 70 mg. for one week. Although it worked in a fashion similar to Adderall, I feel as if I have better control taking the medicine 3 x a day. The Vyvanse would wear off and then come back and start to work again and I found it disconcerting; it was like a roller coaster. With Adderall, I can expect it will begin to wear off after 4-5 hours and I simply take another one, usually before it has lost its effectiveness, and I feel the same all day.""",7,1-Oct-12,22

Like so many others, I had severe menopausal symptoms,  mood swings that made my fiance think I was bipolar, and attempted suicide twice in a 3 month period, which is very unlike me. It caused weight gain, which I&#039;d never had, and threw me into early menopause at the age of 46, 8 years after treatment.

-It was MUCH cheaper than anything else. I just had to pay my deductible.
CONS:
-I&#039;ve had my period for what feels like forever. In the beginning, it was just slightly longer than my normal period and slowly increased to where I&#039;m lucky to have 3 days without it in 3 months
-I&#039;ve had minor hair thinning, nothing noticeable to others
-I feel more depressed
-I&#039;ve gotten many more urinary tract infection (probably from such long periods)

176205,Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve been taking Lorazapam for many years but usually not more than once a week for really bad anxiety. The problem is it&#039;s addictive and you want and need to take more to get the relief you were getting before. So the more you take, the higher the tolerance and you need to keep going up and taking it more often. Another problem is the half life for Lorazapam is between 4 and 8 hours. This means you should really take it 3 times per day. If you don&#039;t you start getting reflex anxiety. After the dosage wears out your anxiety goes up. This was what I experienced and I went through the worst time in my 17 years. 8 weeks ago I stopped taking Lorazapam and switched to Diazapam to taper off. I suggest staying off this drug.""",2,4-Apr-17,17

When I first got the BC I did experience dryness and an infection from over using tampons because I was unsure of what was happening. 3 month long periods are no fun. Within a year my periods came regularly but last from 10-16 days every time. This is an undesirable side effect; but still no pregnancy.

So far Trintillex is the only antidepressant I have been able to tolerate. It allows me to function. I actually sing sometimes which was so rare for me. I cannot live without it. Unfortunately, it is expensive (even with insurance). I would give it a 10, but I have to pay so much money each month to get it.""",9,21-Oct-17,21

61662,Citalopram,Depression,"""I was very depressed after experiencing loss of two family members within 2 weeks. Started citalopram 10mg once a day for a week then went to 20 mg once a day. 
The first week, there was no change in me. The second week was much better. I was always a quiet , non talkative person but now I speak a lot more and am more sociable (which I don&#039;t really care to be) but considering the alternative...
This drug definitely helped with the depression. I&#039;ve only been on it a little over 3 weeks now. I did experience side effects such as headaches, not being able to fall asleep, and I&#039;m very jumpy...a small noise or whatever will startle me. But I&#039;ll gladly put up with those for the relief this drug has given me.""",10,10-May-16,17

It came back after it was almost better two weeks later and I went to the Dr. He prescribed Ziana which I use at night and my face not only got 100% better with 0 blemishes but it has not broken out again since.

Everythings been well, I&#039;ve got lighter and shorter periods, which I love! No abnormal things happening like mood swings or hairloss like other are experiencing.

113929,Amlodipine,Migraine Prevention,"""Using 5mg since 8 months. It prevents me from severe pain in the base of my skull (perhaps occipital neuralgia). The important point to be noted in my case is the timing of taking the medicine. I mostly get the pains in early morning while in deep sleep. Before taking this med, I would wake up in severe pain that would last until I take a painkiller. Than I started taking amlodipine 5mg at night. However, I need to take the medicine about 10~12 hours before the onset of the pain. If I am late, I would get the pain on the same time in morning in spite of taking the pill. However, in such case, the pain gradually diminishes as the time approaches to the required time.   

Looking forward to hear from those suffering from similar conditions.""",9,5-Dec-16,11

142941,Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""Okay so Nexplanon is useful in the sense that you&#039;re safe from pregnancy etc. But what it&#039;s done to me mentally is not pleasant in the slightest. I go through 2 week periods of feeling completely myself and then suddenly drop into these phases of chronic anxiety and exhaustion. I  have intrusive thoughts that do not help my anxiety in the slightest and I just feel so isolated from everyone. My mum had told me that I&#039;m not myself anymore and that&#039;s just the hardest thing to hear because I&#039;ve noticed it too. I&#039;m usually energetic, enthusiastic and bubbly but during these periods I have no motivation. I&#039;m getting it out in a few days, I just need to be myself again, I hate feeling like this and cannot cope any longer.""",2,29-Jul-17,9
