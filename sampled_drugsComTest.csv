I had been on Betapace for 15 years and have had 4 ICDs/ Pacemakers after being diagnosed with an idiopathic DCM in 1996 and surviving 3 cardiac arrests now.

INR stabilized, sweats went away, and headaches went away in about 10 days.

126201,Viibryd,Depression,"""Medicaid covers this! I&#039;m ending week 3 on Viibryd - 2 weeks on 10mg, finishing 1st week on 20mg. 
Had lots of tummy trouble after 1st dose (diarrhea, slight nausea, lots of bloating &amp; gas), but it has lessened, but not good yet.  
I take it with lunch. (Also on Synthroid - empty stomach in morning, Wellbutrin -450/day x 10  yrs) 
Main other side effects: a bit more anxiety, electric-zappy/restless legs in the evening (getting better), other muscle twitches at first, trouble getting to sleep (worse after dosing up to 20mg). I do feel a little more energy and a little more positive. Not interested in food during the day after taking Viibryd, mostly due to upset tummy.  I get HUGE cravings for sweets in the evening (must be after it wears off).""",7,3-Aug-12,12
91933,Lyrica,Neuropathic Pain,"""I feel the need to warn everybody about the side effects and how difficult it can be to get off this drug. I&#039;ve been on it for approximately 8 years before the side effects really started kicking in. Began as morning anxiety attacks, severe GI upset, mood swings and low to mid level depression. Tried changing the schedule from twice a day to three times a day. It helped at first but about two months later my body began anticipating new schedule and the side effects would start kicking in about an hour before next dose. Its taken me 8 months to get dosage down from 225 mg a day to 75mg a day and every step down has been sheer hell. Every step down leads to a period of depression, and it gets worse the closer you get to zero.""",2,2-Sep-15,63
125264,Dulcolax,Constipation,"""Took one pill around 11:30 at night just to try it out because I have never taken a laxative before. Then I decided to read the reviews on this website and was horrified for what was about to come. I took two ibuprofen just in case and finally got to bed around 3. It woke me up at 5 in the morning and did its job just fine in about a half an hour and I then I woke back up at around 11am and it did it again with no pain. This worked for me!""",10,27-Mar-16,20
300,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,"""I started the shot when I was 14 to regulate my periods and as I&#039;ve read a lot of women say it made them worse, but for me the first few months made it worse for me I bleed for almost 2 months but after I got my second shot my periods stopped completely. It is also a great birth control, personally I gained only alittle weight (5-7 pounds) but I liked it because I&#039;m considered smaller than average. My stomach gets bloated and my back hurts when I&#039;m due for my next shot and I get a little moody but other than that it&#039;s been pretty good. My breasts and bum grew which is a plus. I recommend it for a birth control.""",9,22-Feb-15,5

149287,Mirena,Birth Control,"""I definitely recommend the Mirena as an option for birth control. I decided to get it my senior year in high school because I have goals to achieve and I did not want any babies stopping that. I started off with pills but I realized my lifestyle did not fit that. If you do not want to worry about taking a pill on time EVERYDAY, and worry about the possibilities of you becoming pregnant, get the Mirena. It didn&#039;t hurt much and now all I&#039;m doing is spotting. Take this from a teenager, it DOES work.""",9,11-Mar-15,23

I&#039;m so much happier, I have heaps more confidence, and all in all my life just works better when I&#039;m on it. I only came off it as a trial but I went back on after a month; I don&#039;t like the way I am without it I&#039;m irritable, and cry easily and obsess about everything!

I&#039;m now switching pills to see if I can bring back my old self. I have taken YAZ for 14 months and am now taking my month which will make it 15 months. To say I&#039;m tired is not the word and shifting weight is near impossible. I have exercised and dieted with nothing more than a pound gained or the scale not moving. I also have in between bleeding. After taking the 15th day  I am guaranteed brown discharge and then some spotting, which I shouldn&#039;t be getting.

I inserted the medication on my lunch at work with out using the cream or wipes. I then started reading reviews which freaked me out and I got so scared. Nothing happened for a few hours then there was a slight burning sensation. Nothing horrible. Some of the medication came out on the pad I was wearing, and the uncomfortableness lasted the rest of the night. I woke up fine and the yeast infection was gone. Worked for me, and will use this again.""",10,6-Feb-17,10

Previously to getting liletta, I been losing weight and was continuing exactly what I had done before. By the end of February, I was having bad cramps and acne. My skin was awful. Every day there were new spots on my face. &amp; My cramps hurt so bad I had to call into work one day. The final straw was the depression that hit me.

One thing rosacea sufferers have to realize is that this treatment takes time. I would have to say that it took a good 2.5 months to start seeing noticeable improvement with continued improvement the longer I use it. On a side note I would like to add that my ears would flush when triggered by heat or stress and so I started to use Metrogel on them and it has helped reduce the flushing. Overall pretty happy with results only negative aspect is the amount of time it takes for it to work.""",9,29-Feb-12,110

My brain fog started to clear and my moods stabilised.  I&#039;m not saying that I don&#039;t have bad days, I do.  The side effects are transitory so hang in there.

I was crampy for about a day and was already bleeding as I was on my period so I wouldn&#039;t have known the difference from spotting and my period. But its been over 4 months now n I&#039;m still spotting. Mainly that brown end of the period kind of junk, can&#039;t really tell whats my actual period anymore. I do lighty bleed for a few days then it&#039;ll just go back to that brown spotting. Doctor said 3 months for spotting but the actual Mirena site said up to 6 months so well see here in a month or so.
